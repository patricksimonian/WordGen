notes:
  This program and its contents (in the 1.0 release) was and has been written
entirely by the author! For that reason, it could absolutely be improved on
and will be therein. Additionally, there is a small Regular Expression which
is functional but is not 100% operational. It's purpose is for users who are
new to RegExp (such as my self) to familiarize your self with some basic
expressions. A great resource for regexp can be found at https://regex101.com
