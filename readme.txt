notes:
  This program and its contents (in the 1.0 release) was and has been written
entirely by the author! For that reason (as well as myself only coding for
about 1 month), it could absolutely be improved on!
 Additionally, there is a small Regular Expression which is functional
but not 100% operational. It's purpose is for users who are
new to RegExp (such as my self) to familiarize themselves with some basic
expressions. A great resource for regexp can be found at https://regex101.com
